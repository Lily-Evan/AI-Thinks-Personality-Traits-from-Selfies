AI Thinks : Personality Traits from Selfies
About Dataset
This dataset provides a synthetic collection of face images (represented as URLs to preserve privacy) along with AI-generated interpretations of personality traits. Using advanced computer vision models (CLIP-ViT-B/32 and GPT-4V), each selfie was analyzed to predict scores for extroversion, confidence, trustworthiness, smile intensity, and eye contact. Demographic and emotional metadata was also generated to provide context for analysis and model development.

Itâ€™s ideal for projects involving:

Personality prediction

AI fairness and bias analysis

Facial expression recognition

Social psychology simulations

Exploratory data science and visualizations
